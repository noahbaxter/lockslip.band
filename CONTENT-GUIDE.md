1. **Always use double quotes** around text: `"like this"` not `'like this'`
2. **Commas matter**: Put a comma after each item, except the very last one
3. **File names are case-sensitive**: `photo.jpg` is different from `Photo.JPG`
4. **Test your changes**: Save and refresh to make sure everything works

## üÜò If Something Breaks

1. **Check for typos** - especially missing quotes or commas
2. **Copy your text to jsonlint.com** - it will tell you if there are errors
3. **Look at the working examples** in the files for reference
4. **Make a backup** before making big changes

## üìû Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. Compare your changes to the existing examples
2. Check that all your image files actually exist in the right folders
3. Make sure all web links start with `https://`

The website will show an error message if something is wrong with your content files.
